# 💊 Pillulu · Your Smart Medicine Assistant & Health Companion

Pillulu is an AI-powered smart pill assistant that helps users identify medications, understand their usage, and manage daily intake with intelligent reminders. Designed with accessibility and safety in mind, Pillulu empowers individuals—especially the elderly and chronically ill—to take their medications correctly and confidently.

### 🔐 Environment Variables

To run Pillulu locally, you need to set up a `.env` file to securely store the API key used.  
This file will not be uploaded to GitHub (thanks to `.gitignore`), so your credentials remain private.

#### 🔧 Steps:

1. Create a file named `.env` in the project root file.
2. Add the following line to it (replace with your actual OpenAI API key):

   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
